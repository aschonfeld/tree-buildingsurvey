instrIntro={0}This survey is designed to let you show your understanding of the diversity of living organisms. You will not be graded on whether your answers are "right" or "wrong"; you will receive full credit for completing the survey, no matter what you write. We are most interested in your understanding of these issues. Please do not consult any outside sources (textbooks, the web, other people, etc.) while completing this survey! Imagine that you are working for a natural history museum, like the Harvard Museum of Natural History, only smaller. Your museum has specimens of twenty types of organisms in its collection. Your task is to design a tree diagram that will help orient visitors to the collection. Your tree should include all the organisms and communicate the ways in which they are evolutionarily related to one another. In the program, you will see a list of organisms. Draw a tree diagram to show the relationships between them. Include additional text to help visitors understand how you have organized these groups of organisms. There is no right or wrong answer to this task, but it is important that you are able to explain the logic behind your approach.

instrHeader=INSTRUCTIONS
instrDir=Building your tree: Click and drag to place the organisms on the left side of the screen in a tree configuration that you feel best illustrates the relationships between them.  Drag as many "branch points" into the tree as you like - these may be used to connect organisms to each other, or as labels for parts of the tree.  Add a short text to a branch point with the Label button, if you wish, or leave it blank. Connect branch points and organisms with the Link button. \n\n
instrDir2=Editing your tree: Delete connections by selecting them and clicking Delete or pressing the delete key. To remove all of an object's connections, use the Unlink button.  Remove an organism or branch point from the tree with the Delete button or just drag it back to where you got it from. To start over, press Clear.\n\n 
instrDir3=Finishing your tree: When you're happy with your tree, press the button marked "Questions" to bring up the first of two questions about this task.  Answer the questions as best you can; remember, we are more interested in what you think than in whether you have the "right answer". After answering both questions, press Submit Survey (at the right side of the screen) to save your work and exit. If you close this window without pressing the Submit button, your work will not be saved!\n\n
welcome_instr=To start building your tree, drag organisms from the list at left and connect them with the Link button. Branch points can be used to make your tree's structure clear. Add text to branch points with the Label button.  When you've finished building your tree, click on the button marked "Questions" and answer the questions, then press "Submit Survey" (at the right side of the screen) to save your work and exit. \n Press Help for more detailed instructions.
