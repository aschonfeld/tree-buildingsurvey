#summary Conundrums and puzzlers, mostly about user interface


Created this page to move these discussions onto the web, if that can be done. Think of it as an on-line group meeting without such strict time constraints. Post questions as they occur to you. 

These questions will mostly be arbitrary questions of expected behavior. "What is the correct thing to do?" = "What does the user expect?" or "What is the easiest for the user to figure out". 
Ease of implementation, in principle, should not be a factor in the decision. Impossibility of implementation might be considered an obstacle.

Question: What is the correct action for a double-click on an Organism node? 

  
-------
Question: After dragging, should a Node be the selected object? (should drag transfer selected status to this object?)

--------
Question: True or false - buttons having three states: "grey", "live", and "hot". "Grey" when they cannot operate, "live" when they can be clicked on with effect, and "hot" when they have been clicked on and are awaiting a further selection.
