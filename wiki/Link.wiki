#summary Developer's Guide: Link
Extends: [Command]

Link is the [Command] object corresponding to the Link button, which makes a [Connection] between two [Node]s. 

The execute method is empty (done elsewhere - track this)

Since connections in the TBS Applet are stored as bi-directional (each connection is a "to connection" in the origin node and a "from connection" in the target node) Link's undo method must delete both ends of the connection.
