Question:

Brian<br/>
Seems to me that in "correct" solution each internal node has exactly<br/>
two descendants - never three or more, and there's no need to bother<br/>
with nodes with only one descendant (unless you have fossils in the tree).<br/>
(These are interesting trees from a cs perspective too.)<br/>
But you might want to consider a tree in which everything descended<br/>
from one ur-organism as correct too, in a way.<br/>

Answer:

actually, it is fine to have as many descendants from an internal node as you like<br/>
