#summary Runnning Perl Scripts From the Command-Line in Eclipse

= Introduction =
  # Open Eclipse
  # Run > External Tools > External Tools...
  # Select "Program" from the Configurations box on the left
  # Click "New"
  # Enter `perl -w` in the name field, unless you have a more catchy name
  # Enter the location of your command line executable(ex: `C:\WINDOWS\system32\cmd.exe` in XP) in the Location box
  # Enter the following in the Arguments box:
{{{
  /C "cd ${container_loc} && perl -w ${resource_name}" 
}}}
  # Click Apply
  # Go to the "Common" tab and for the `perl -w` configuration and click the `External Tools` checkbox  in the `Display in favorites menu`
  # Click Apply & hit OK
  # Now select your Perl script (TreeSurvey.pl) and go to Run > External Tools > `perl -w`
  
  After doing this you should see the output from your Perl script in the Console view.  In This case since ours is a CGI script our output will be mostly HTML code.  This is good from running quickly with debug statements to see where possible errors are occuring.
