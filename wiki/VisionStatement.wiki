#summary Vision Statement

=Proposed Vision Statement =


   The TBS group envisions a world in which research in biology education is facilitated by appropriate software tools for eliciting students' intuitions on biological classifications.


=Previous proposal:=

  Our group's vision is to become a leader in software development.  Being a leader means gaining client satisfaction by providing on-time delivery of innovative, up-to-date, under budget, working software applications.*


= Discussion = 
  * Prof. Bolker's objections seem to stem from the fact that this doesn't actually relate to the product. Since this group exists precisely and solely to work on this project, that seems a valid objection. "Your vision statement should describe your vision for the deliverable." Well and good, my attempt is above. Please amend. -jpk
  * Seems fine to me. Apparently my understanding of the vision statements of Coca-Cola, General Motors and McDonald's was pretty far off.  Thanks for taking the reins on it. -as
