#summary Amy the freshman Biology 101 student uses TBS

= The Story Of Amy =

Amy is a freshman student in Biology 101.  She receives an e-mail from the professor teaching Biology 101 containing a link to the Tree Building Survey website.  Also in the e-mail is the username and password for her to log into the TBS site.  Her first assignment is to log into TBS and follow the instructions.  She logs into the TBS and is presented with a screen with a group of organisms on the left.  The instructions tell her to create an evolution tree based on how the different organisms are related to eachother.  She drags a few organisms over and connects lines between them. However, she doesn't know exactly what the professor is looking for.  She thinks the instructions are too vague.  She e-mails the professor and asks for an example of what he's looking for.  He e-mails her back that he is just looking to see how much students already know coming in, and that she should just draw the tree to the best of her ability.  She is still confused and asks a friend of hers who is a Biology major what the professor is looking for.  Her friend gives her an example, and she completes the evolution tree.  She gets 10 points for completing the survey.
