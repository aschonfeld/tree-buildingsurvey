*Initial Version of GUI Code - UML Diagram *

I have uploaded a pdf file containing the UML class diagram of the GUI code as supplied by Professor White

I used the Java To UML editor plugin for Eclipse, a UML editor (Topcased), and PrimoPDF

The filename is:

"UML Class Diagram Of Initial GUI Code (as supplied by Professor White).pdf"

*How to generate a UML File From a Java Project In Eclipse*

  # Place "org.topcased.java.reverse_0.2.0.jar " in your "eclipse/plugins/" directory (where "eclipse" is the base directory of your eclipse install).
  # Start Eclipse
  # Go to File > New > Project and select the "Java Project From Exising Ant Buildfile" wizard
  # Click "Browse" and select "Phylogeny Survey/build.xml" (from wherever you put Prof. White's code)
  # In the package view in the left window: right click "Phylogeny Survey", and select "UML From Java" from the menu (towards the bottom)
  # Click the "Finish" button in the window that pops up (the default name is "model.uml")

There should now be a file "model.uml" in the directory "workspace/Phylogeny Survey/" (where "workspace" is wherever your eclipse workspace directory is).

You should now be able to open "model.uml" for viewing in a UML editor
