= Compiling and Running Your Eclipse Projects From Command-Line =

= Creating A Local Server and Running Applet From It w/ Eclipse & Apache =
  * Follow the instructions in these two Wiki pages:
    # [ApacheEclipseSetup Apache Tomcat Eclipse Setup Instructions]
    # [EclipsePerlCGIDeployment Eclipse Perl CGI Deployment Instructions]

= Installing MySQL & Creating Local Database (Coming Soon) =
  # Download and install [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ MySQL]
  # Once the download is complete, open up MySQL Command Line Client
  # You will need to enter the root password that you created during the installation
  # Locate the file 'phylogenySurvey.sql' in the documents folder of the checked out Applet project
    * This will be in the workspace folder of your eclipse projects, mine is C:\workspace
  # In the command line run the command:
    * `source [location of checked out Applet project]\documents\phylogenySurvey.sql`
  # Do the following [PerlMySQLDBI Perl MySQL DBI] setup
  # There will be two other files within the documents folder from two steps earlier of the extension `.pm`, drop these two files into the `WebContent\WEB-INF\cgi\' for the Local Server project you created earlier
  * *Now your database should be all set for running a local version of the Applet complete with saving!*
