#summary Developer's Guide: RadioQuestionPrompt (Needs review)

= Introduction =

This Prompt is used to display the radio questions, now discontinued. It is left in the codebase to allow the radio questions to be restored easily, but it has not been as thoroughly tested as other classes. Check your work if you put this back in. 


= Details =
The intent and effect of methods in this class should be clear from their names. Code is a little hairy in places, but it should be clear on careful review.
