Empty Nodes (labelled "Branch Point" when running the applet) are user-created junction points used in creating the tree structure. The correct understanding of these objects is probably the most important factor in a student's success in building a tree. 

Empty Nodes differ from [OrganismNode Organism Nodes] in that they can be created and  labelled by the student. They also have a generic appearance, rather than a distinct image file.
