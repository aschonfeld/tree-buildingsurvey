#summary The projected course of development of the tree-building survey.

== Introduction ==

This is a first draft of the schedule. Team members, please modify the format in any way that you think useful. Also, of course the data. <br>
Dates are guesses in some instances, or ???? if I don't have enough data to usefully guess. <br>
"Track" is my notion for identifying dependencies. We know that there are two parallel tracks already: projecting and prioritizing features to be developed ("features") and refactoring the current code ("refactor"). "Main" indicates items relevant to both tracks. This is probably not the right way to do this, it's just the way I thought of.  <br>
"Preliminary schedule" will be done when we have all signed off on this schedule page, and each of the ???? items has at least one finite, boolean subtask with a definite near-term (<2 weeks) completion date. I suggest that the short stories may qualify as a subtask for "client meeting".

== Discussion ==


Discussion of the mechanics of scheduling - if you want to elucidate or justify your changes, here's a place for that. Or if you want to comment without changing, also fine, although concrete changes are preferable. 
Also, thoughts on the overall path can happen here. <br>
Discussion of particular items should happen on dedicated pages. 
<br>

10/08 - I'm checking off two of the items for today as done. We have finite schedule items under "client meeting" (develop user stories) and "build" (local builds by Tuesday), and a terminal date for the refactor track (11/05). As for the vision statement, we have one. It's probably not one that will be signed off on, so it still needs work, but it's there. Next step is to make it approvable by next Thursday. <br>
