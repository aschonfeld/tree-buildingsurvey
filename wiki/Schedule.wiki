#summary The projected course of development of the tree-building survey.
#labels Featured

== Introduction ==

This is a first draft of the schedule. Team members, please modify the format in any way that you think useful. Also, of course the data. <br>
Dates are guesses in some instances, or ???? if I don't have enough data to usefully guess. <br>
"Track" is my notion for identifying dependencies. We know that there are two parallel tracks already: projecting and prioritizing features to be developed ("features") and refactoring the current code ("refactor"). "Main" indicates items relevant to both tracks. This is probably not the right way to do this, it's just the way I thought of.  <br>
"Preliminary schedule" will be done when we have all signed off on this schedule page, and each of the ???? items has at least one finite, boolean subtask with a definite near-term (<2 weeks) completion date. I suggest that the short stories may qualify as a subtask for "client meeting".

== Discussion ==

10/20 - We did not discuss the question of further feature development in class today, so that's a missed schedule item (and it's even one that we rolled back, for shame).
I suggest we carry on that discussion via the wiki for the moment, over on the [Features features] page. 
On the other hand, we did get a logo selected and posted, so hurray for us. New schedule items are up, and one is completed - sort of - before it's posted.

Later: test cases for toy GUI are posted, please review and approve or suggest changes. 


10/15
I assume that Professor White's vision statement is acceptable to all of us - accepted by acclamation, without dissent. 
Andrew, if you agree that you're the lead on "develop build system", please erase the question mark. If not, we need to address that item. 


10/08 - I'm checking off two of the items for today as done. We have finite schedule items under "client meeting" (develop user stories) and "build" (local builds by Tuesday), and a terminal date for the refactor track (11/05). As for the vision statement, we have one. It's probably not one that will be signed off on, so it still needs work, but it's there. Next step is to make it approvable by next Thursday. <br>
