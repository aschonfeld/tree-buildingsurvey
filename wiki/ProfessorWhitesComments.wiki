<h1>1/14/10</h1><br>
I've given it a quick look and have three things:
<ul>
  <li>It does not seem to save my tree - did I do something wrong?</li>
  <li>We had talked about 4 versions (+/- arrowheads X +/- tree in instructions). Although this would be good, I'd prefer to have one working version to nothing.</li>
  <li>I will need to know if it is not going to be running before friday feb 5 so I can tell the students to not worry about doing it.</li>
</ul>
