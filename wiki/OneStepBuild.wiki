_The exact information that follows may also be found in `/branches/rewrite/README.txt` in the SVN_<br>

=== Deployment Notes: ===
*Prerequisites:*<br>
  # You must go to the google code site, http://code.google.com/p/tree-buildingsurvey/, and download the existing project one of two ways.
   * A) Download Tortoise SVN and use the directions listed on the "Source" tab of the google code page to checkout the current project
   * B) Go to the "Downloads" tab and download the latest .zip file of the project
  # You must have Java 6(or most recent version) installed on your computer
  # You must have Ant 1.7(or latest version) installed on your computer

=== Steps for Deployment: ===

  # go to the directory of your local copy of the project in the command line
  # run the command "ant jarfile", this creates your jarfile that executes the applet
  # run the command "ant javadoc", this creates the javadoc to be viewed on the web
  # update the file applet.html with the current version notes (new functions, future functions, removed functions, etc.)
   * You can do this by adding a some simple text within a `<p>` tag above the `<applet>` tag
  # run the command, 
   * `"ant -Dversion=[version number] -Dusername=[server username] -Dpassw=[server password] -Dhostname=[server name] -Dserver_dir= [server directory] deploy"`,
    * this will deploy the application on whichever server you would like to house it
  # update the wiki links to the updated version on the google code wiki(this step only required for TBS Dev Group members)
   * "Test Current Tree-Building Applet" link on home page
   * "Test Applets", wiki page (http://code.google.com/p/tree-buildingsurvey/wiki/Applets)
   * wiki table of contents (http://code.google.com/p/tree-buildingsurvey/w/edit/TableOfContents)
