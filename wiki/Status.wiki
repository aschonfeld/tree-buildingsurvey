10/20: Rebooting the project. Decision made to discard previous code and rebuild the functionality, approximating as closely as possible the behavior of the version supplied by Professor White. This decision based on the radical nature of the changes required to implement the desired behavior, which would amount to a near-total rewrite. Initial step will be to construct a 4-panel GUI capable of reflecting simple data in four different forms. Successive steps must still be scheduled; detailing this is the next critical event. 


=Old status report=
Group met during class session. Some discussion of how to proceed, no firm events scheduled. 

Events/milestones to be scheduled (some of many)

  * Meet with client to discuss project requirements, prioritize features, discuss details of UI options
  * Meet with previous code writer to discuss details of code handoff (ie, we've got questions about the architecture we've inherited)


Decisions to be made

  * Refactor or rewrite? (current leaning of the group is strongly towards refactor)

Administrative necessities (add or delete as you see fit)
  * Schedule
  * Group coding conventions

Undertakings:

  * Jon will generate Javadoc for the current code this weekend
  * Glenn will review code with an eye to refactoring
  * Andrew is working on getting code up and running on a second server, with "up and running" to be specified
  * All will test the current release (Prof. White's server) on their available browsers, report results.
