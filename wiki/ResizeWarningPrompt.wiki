#summary Developer's Guide: ResizeWarningPrompt (Incomplete)

= Introduction =
Puts a warning on the screen. Must review code to see exactly which warning: properties id "resizewarning"

= Details =
A simple alert box. Much of the work is done by helper methods in Prompt and TSGraphics. 
Looks like this may have been rewritten from the WelcomePrompt.
