#summary Developer's Guide: TextEntryBox (Incomplete)
#labels incomplete

= Introduction =

Displays a text entry box. This one has some tricky stuff for text handling. 
Not clear where called

= Details =

keyPressed(KeyEvent e)

keystrokes are handled by a long if chain, which nests down to three levels. Sorry. 
Keystrokes handled are: Delete, left and right arrows, Enter, alphanumeric.

TO INVESTIGATE: 
 - distinction between keyTyped and keyPressed?
 - use of timer?
