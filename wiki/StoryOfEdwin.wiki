#summary The Story of Edwin

Edwin is a researcher in the field of biology education, using the Tree-Building System to elicit intuitions about phylogeny from his freshman students. He is concerned that certain aspects of the presentation of the questions may prejudice the answers his students provide, thus obscuring the facts he is trying to uncover. Fortunately, the program is designed with a selectable user interface switch in which a number of the variables of presentation have been supplied with binary switches, so he can test for this effect. For this run, he is interested in testing two variables: whether the presence of a directional marker on the connecting line makes a difference to student performance, and also whether asking students to label nodes has an effect on how they group organisms. To do this, he logs in as an administrator and selects "UI test: 2X2", and selects the appropriate settings for conditions A and B. The program then assigns students randomly to one of four test conditions, with A=true and A=false crossed by B=true and B=false. 
When Edwin's class has finished taking the survey, their data can be reported out according to the conditions the students were assigned to, or as a whole, making analysis a breeze.
