==How to install and run the binary-only !AdminApplication (with student trees)==

*Step 1*: Click [http://tree-buildingsurvey.googlecode.com/files/AdminApplicationBinary.zip here] to download the stand-alone administrator application<br>

*Step 2*: Double click on `AdminApplicationBinary.zip` and extract the `AdminApplicationBinary` folder to the location of your choosing.

*Step 3*: Open the `AdminApplicationBinary` folder and double click on `AdminApplication.jar` to start the application

_If you do not have Java, or have an older version, you can get the latest version from_ [http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp here]

To select what student tree to view, click on the row in the table that contains the data for that tree.

We did not have time to write up a user manual for this application, but you can learn how it works by exploring the menu items.  However, avoid using "Import Data", since there is currently no data to import, and this has not been thoroughly tested.  Also, "Reset Data" will simply make all the student trees unviewable.  Restarting the application will fix this problem.
