#summary PLACEHOLDER Developer's Guide: TBSModel.java

= Introduction =
TBSModel is the superclass for the two Model objects representing the data under inspection. The two Models - [StudentModel] and [AdminModel] - have somewhat different ways of handling data due to the differing needs of the two classes of users. 

== Methods ==

findIndexByID()


getElementBySN()
Returns the ModelElement with the given serial number. This method relies on the fact that objects are added in serial# order, and remain sorted, although they may be deleted. If this assumption ceases to be true, this method will fail.

hasConnections()
returns true if there are any connections in the tree. Used to determine whether "unlink" buttons should be active.

hasEmptyNodes()
returns true if the current tree has any empty nodes in it. Used to determine whether the Label button should be active. 

inTreeElements
Returns the list of active elements. Note that this includes all elements in the Model, not only those connected to the tree. 

outOfTreeElements()
Return the list of elements not in the tree, that is, the elements still in the left-hand column. This list will include the "immortal empty node", or at least it should, MUST CHECK THIS

public boolean isElementsInTree() 

setElementsInTree(boolean elementsInTree)

===load===

loadTree()
loadOrganismNode()
loadEmptyNode()
loadConnection()


printConnections()
Prints out a list of all connections for each element in the model. Not currently used, but retained for testing purposes. 

exportTree() 
Creates and returns a String representing the tree, by iterating the elements of the model and calling the [ModelElement dump()] method of each. The list of elements is obtained by calling inTreeElements in this class. 

checkElementIntegrity()
Reviews the list of elements and returns a warning if any ID number is duplicated or if any element is connected to an element which doesn't exist. 
Useful for testing, but sucks cycles. Don't call in production!
