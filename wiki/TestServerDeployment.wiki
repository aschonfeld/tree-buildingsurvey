#summary Steps for Deploying Code to Test Server

  Before doing anything make sure that the follwing lines of code have been updated in the perl script that you will be deploying or else errors will occur.
  # {{{$script_url = "http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/cgi-bin/Test/TreeSurvey.pl"}}}
  # {{{print "archive=\"http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/Test/phylogenySurvey.jar\" \n";}}}

= Steps =
  # Download [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html pscp] to `C:\`
  # Open up the command-line and goto `C:\`
  # To send your .pl file to the server, use the following: {{{pscp [location of perl script]\TreeSruvey.pl root@cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu:/var/www/cgi-bin/Test/}}}
  # Enter the password.
  # Do the same for the .jar file: `pscp [location of .jar]\phylogenySurvey.jar root@cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu:/var/www/html/Test/`
  # Download [http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html putty]
  # Go to server, cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu
  # use (User:root, Password:********)
  # Type the following commands: 
    * `cd /var/www/cgi-bin/Test/`
    * `chmod +x TreeSurvey.pl`
    * `cd /var/www/html/Test/`
    * `chown nobody:nobody phylogenySurvey.jar`
    * `chmod +x phylogenySurvey.jar`

(password available from Jon or Andrew)

  Now You should be able to access your updated code from the following link http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/cgi-bin/Test/TreeSurvey.pl

_Note: These steps could be subject to change if we move from using a perl CGI script to using servlets or JSF_
