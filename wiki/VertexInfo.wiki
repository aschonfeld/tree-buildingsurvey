#summary Developer's Guide: VertexInfo

= Introduction =
VertexInfo contains the information about a [Vertex] object. 



= Details =

A Node is converted into a Vertex for scoring. The Vertex has a set of properties which are encapsulated in the VertexInfo class for convenience. The Vertex is of a Type (ORGANISM or EMPTY), which is calculated from the presence or absence of an associated image. Other properties are taken directly from the Node in question.
