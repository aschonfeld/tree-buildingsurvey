#summary Questions and Comments from the Professor

I'm glad to see test applets loaded. I seem to find several, in several places. They need to be better documented. I have some suggestions. First, put all the links to applets on just one page. Second, post them in reverse chronological order (newest first). Finally, make sure that each applet is self documenting, so that when someone is looking at s/he  can know the version number and the date (that can be a simple text field in the applet, or the title of the containing web page). Then when a bug is reported the report can (and should!) say which version the bug was detected in. That will save time when versions are superseded since some old bugs can be marked as moot when they fixed themselves.

The schedule shows the build system as complete. But I can't find out on this wiki how to get the latest version of the code from svn and build it and test it. (I do see the instructions for the technology stack, but not how those pieces go together.)

You're misusing the downloads page. It should offer the latest version(s) of the working application, for people to download and install - code, documentation, installation instructions. The things there now are part of your internal development processes and belong elsewhere on the wiki.

I have some quite detailed schedule specifications I'll suggest this afternoon in class.

Items on the schedule should be listed in chronological order - it's hard to read the current version.

There's very little on the schedule beyond the items for a few days ago. Refactoring architecture is due in two days. Will it be done?

The vision statement is marked as done (pending client approval) but I don't think it's done at all!

This might be useful, at least for a first test. No good for exercising Java, though.

Your (draft) vision statement is all about you and not at all about what you're trying to build. Moreover, it's all completely generic boilerplate. Sounds like Dilbert.

Your vision statement should describe your vision for the deliverable. That's the important part. After you've done that, you can add a sentence about what good engineers you intend to be.

Thanks for the schedule page. I suggest another column for "Done" rather than overwriting the due date when the item is done. Keeping the original due date helps when you look back to see if you were meeting the schedule you set - particularly if you put the actual completion date in the "Done" column.

The wiki needs a schedule page, so that all the things you said at your first meeting you would do soon have dates attached.
