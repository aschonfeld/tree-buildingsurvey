Items on the schedule should be listed in chronological order - it's hard to read the current version.

There's very little on the schedule beyond the items for a few days ago. Refactoring architecture is due in two days. Will it be done?

The vision statement is marked as done (pending client approval) but I don't think it's done at all!

This might be useful, at least for a first test. No good for exercising Java, though.

Your (draft) vision statement is all about you and not at all about what you're trying to build. Moreover, it's all completely generic boilerplate. Sounds like Dilbert.

Your vision statement should describe your vision for the deliverable. That's the important part. After you've done that, you can add a sentence about what good engineers you intend to be.

Thanks for the schedule page. I suggest another column for "Done" rather than overwriting the due date when the item is done. Keeping the original due date helps when you look back to see if you were meeting the schedule you set - particularly if you put the actual completion date in the "Done" column.

The wiki needs a schedule page, so that all the things you said at your first meeting you would do soon have dates attached.
