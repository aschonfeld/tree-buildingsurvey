The wiki needs a schedule page, so that all the things you said at your first meeting you would do soon have dates attached.

Thanks for the schedule page. I suggest another column for "Done" rather than overwriting the due date when the item is done. Keeping the original due date helps when you look back to see if you were meeting the schedule you set - particularly if you put the actual completion date in the "Done" column.
