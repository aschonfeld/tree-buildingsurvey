More on subversion: To connect to the new branch as a separate project in Eclipse, this worked for me:

 # Create a new workspace. This may be optional, but the only way I was able to make Eclipse create the new project as a separate project was to do it in a new workspace.
 # Select "Import" under file menu
 # Select SVN/Checkout Projects From SVN as import source
 # Create a new repository location: 'https://tree-buildingsurvey.googlecode.com/svn/branches/rewrite'
 # Select it for checkout. It'll offer to use a new project setup wizard, you can try that if you want - I just did a bare project create, it seemed to work.
 # That should get you what's there, which is nothing at the moment, just some junk to test this all on. Let me know if there's any trouble. 
 # Be aware that this is probably not the best procedure under normal branching conditions, but this ain't them, so we'll do it this way for now.

=Model - View - Controller=

Professor White's code starts with the assumption that every object of biological interest _is_ a graphics object. That's a serious design error. 

In this application there should be classes that represent the underlying biological _model_: perhaps just Species. Some of the instances are actual organisms - they are provided at startup. Others are the intermediate nodes the user creates. The biology models the user's ideas about evolution by allowing for links between species - maybe directed, maybe not. These objects know nothing about how they look on the screen. 

The classes specifying the graphics are separate. 

The connection can be managed using the Observer-Observable design pattern. The graphics objects are registered as Observers of the model objects. When the user makes a change to the model (by adding or modifying a link or a node) the model notifies the listeners (the Observers), who redraw the screen. (Changes in position don't change the model, but they do change the appearance.)

Plan to do this refactoring - put it on the schedule. But don't start it until the existing code is bug free.

But do it then, _before_ starting to develop the alternative GUIs that the project calls for.
