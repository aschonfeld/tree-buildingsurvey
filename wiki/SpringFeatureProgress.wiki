*Here was the list of _Admin_ features we would possibly like to incorporate into the project. These do not have a timetable for deliverable:*
  # Update HTML generated by Perl script
    * Update perl script to handle both a student & an admin login
      * *In Progress* (Andrew)
    * Add 'Admin' boolean check-box to the login-screen
      * *In Progress* (Andrew)
    * Add a drop-down of students for selection which upon selection would update the applet to show that student's information
      * *Eliminated Due To UI Change* (Andrew)
    * For this version we will need a way to update the Applet with the Admin's student selection
      * *Eliminated Due To UI Change* (Andrew) 
  # Redesign of the applet view
    * Change the node resivoir to a selectable list of students
      * *Completed* (Andrew)
    * Removing all buttons & showing only three new buttons (Tree, Open Responses, Analysis)
      * *Completed* (Andrew)
    * Adding pop-up prompt with a smooth display of each Open-response question & its response
      * *In Progress* (Andrew)
    * Adding pop-up prompt with a smooth display of analysis from the scoring algorithm's assessment of the student's tree
      * *Unassigned*

*Other features that will need Professor White's collaboration.  These may not be instuted in time for our Late January/Early February  deliverable:*
  # Which buttons will be considered modes(ex: link button stay selected until user clicks empty space)
    * *Completed First Release* (Team)
  # Accurate name for empty node (suggestions: editable, free, generic, anonymous, labelable, blank)
    * _One suggestion for this question is that whichever name we decide upon it should be related to the name of the button for labeling.  So, "labelable" would go with what we are using now "label", but if we used "editable" the button would be changed to "edit"_
      * *Completed* (Team)
    * We would also like to add when user hovers over organism node in "label" mode it will change the mouse cursor to an 'X' or a red circle with a line through it.
      * *Completed* (Andrew)
