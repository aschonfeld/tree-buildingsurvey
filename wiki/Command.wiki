#summary Developer's Guide: Command (in progress)

to do: links, more detail on command stack

= Introduction =

The TBS Applet maintains a record of the actions taken by a student in the course of a session. This record allows the student to undo actions back to the start of the session. Note that history is not saved between sessions, this has two consequences. The first os that a student cannotdo actions taken in a previous session; if te student leaves the applet and returns to continue building their model, they can only undo actions taken since the most recent startup of the applet. The other consequence is that the professor cannot review the sequence of actions taken by the student in building the tree. 
Saving the sequence of actions taken across sessions would be possible with some work. This would, at a guess, increase the disk usage of each student by a factor of not more than ten. 

*History/undo bugs may still be present, and are very difficult to trace and repair. This area would be a very good place to focus attention if improvements to the applet are contemplated. Unit testing would be useful here.*

= Details =

The abstract class Command requires only that its extending classes contain instructions for executing and undoing a command, and that they override the toString method with a reasonable label for the command. 

Extending classes - commands in the TBS Applet - are:
Add, Delete, Drag, Label, Link, and Unlink

Notice that a command need not be triggered by a button press (Drag) and that not all button actions are Commands (Undo, for example, cannot be undone)
