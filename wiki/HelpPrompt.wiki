#summary Developer Guide: HelpPrompt (Needs Review)


= Introduction =
Displays the help window, which can be switched among several categories of help. 
Strings are read from properties files, and can be changed without touching the code.* 
"Introduction" is read from "instructions.properties", property name "instrIntro" "Instructions" tab is read from "instructions.properties", properties "InstrDir", "InstrDir2", and "InstrDir3". "Button Info" is read from "help.properties". "Survey Status" is generated based on the current state of the Model. (model.surveyStatus)
(*this is not strictly true, there are still a few strings which are hard-coded)
