Here are links to different versions of Applets:
  * [http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/applet.html Version 1.0]<br/>Professor White's original Applet with a slight tweak to make the organisms appear. Call this Version 0.0

  * [http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/test_applet.html Test Applet] <br> Testing a simpler applet, to make sure that works. This is not related to the Tree, it simply displays some graphics on the screen.<br> (after testing) It seems to - the intermittent failure of some graphic elements to appear is reproduced on another server, so it's an error in my applet, not in the server. However, I'm still unable to load the White applet (Mac OS X.5.8, all browsers), so there's something weird going on.
