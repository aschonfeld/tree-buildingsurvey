Here are links to different versions of Applets:
  * [http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/applet.html Version 1.0]<br/>Professor White's original Applet with a slight tweak to make the organisms appear. Call this Version 0.0

  * [http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/test_applet.html Test Applet] <br> Testing a simpler applet, to make sure that works. This is not related to the Tree, it simply displays some graphics on the screen.<br> (after testing) It seems to - the intermittent failure of some graphic elements to appear is reproduced on another server, so it's an error in my applet, not in the server. However, I'm still unable to load the White applet (Mac OS X.5.8, all browsers), so there's something weird going on.

  * Version 0.1 of Rewritten Applet<br>You can get the files to run it locally from the "Downloads" section under "MVC_Applet_v0.1.zip"<br>The README file gives instructions to run it<br>It does not have tabs, I know how to do them using JFrames, but not JApplets (yet)<br>There is a mouse handler, but it doesn't do anything yet and I'm still working on the rendering<br><br>NOTES:<br>I put the new applet code under branches/rewrite/ in the SVN<br>I was unable to get it to run from "www.cs.umb.edu/~gthelen/applet.html" (it just does nothing)<br>Also, it will not work from a TortiseSVN directory (there is a "java.security.AccessControlException" thrown)<br>It _sometimes_ works in Mozilla (locally by clicking on "applet.html")<br>
