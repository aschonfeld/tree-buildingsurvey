Here are links to different versions of Applets:

    * [http://tree-buildingsurvey.googlecode.com/files/MVC_Applet_v0.1.zip Version 0.1 of Rewritten Applet]<br>Unzip the files from "MVC_Applet_v0.1.zip"<br>The README file gives instructions to run it<br>It does not have tabs, I know how to do them using JFrames, but not JApplets (yet)<br>There is a mouse handler, but it doesn't do anything yet and I'm still working on the rendering<br><br>NOTES:<br>I put the new applet code under branches/rewrite/ in the SVN<br>I was unable to get it to run from "www.cs.umb.edu/~gthelen/applet.html" (it just does nothing)<br>Also, it will not work from a TortiseSVN directory (there is a "java.security.AccessControlException" thrown)<br>It _sometimes_ works in Mozilla (locally by clicking on "applet.html")<br>

  * [http://cluster.bio.whe.umb.edu/applet.html Version 0.0]<br/>Professor White's original Applet with a slight tweak to make the organisms appear.
