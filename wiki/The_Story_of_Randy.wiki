#summary Randy the High School Student Uses TBS

Randy is a student in high school.  Like most teenagers his attention span is short.  His science teacher is currently teaching evolution of organisms and gives Randy the assignment of creating a tree of how he believes organisms originated, using Brian White's TBS site.  Randy has been given a week to complete the assignment, but has waited til the last minute.  He begins the assignments and has trouble understanding the directions for about 20 minutes then finally starts creating nodes. After about 10 minutes he realizes that he has incorrectly labeled a few nodes.  After correcting this problem he realizes his favorite television program is about to begin so he just randomly assigns the remaining organisms to nodes and submits his homework.
