I don't think we are all within the same TREE.  But based upon the species presented and the format of the assignment, I suppose the Jellyfish was the beginning because it is the simpiliest structure, with no major orgins and it has no backbone.  But my understanding and personal observation, once again,  would be that there are multiple beginnings which formed multiple orginisms.Having said that, I arranged the tree to show simpiliest structures first.  Some basic concepts I followed was focusing on limb structure, the complexities of internal organs, and families.+=I decided based upon their characteristics.  If they had similar appendages, and common bone structure.  If they feel under the same family, such as insects, mammals, reptiles etc.  PLease note that I put the turtle under the snail (instead of with the crocodile and lizard), which are also reptiles, due to the fact that the turtle has an outer shell, much like the snail.  These common traits suggest that the turtle may now have characteristics of a reptile but its origins  were derived from a snails body structure.Note that a human is linked directly to a bird (instead of squirrel) for similar reasons as well.+=+=Section 10+=">

Thus this is the first identifying trait used to destinguish the organisms.  For example the leach has no skeletal structure while fish have a formed skeletal structure.  Secondly I destinguished between the two types of skeletal structures (Ie. exoskeleton and endoskeleton).  Since life evolved from the oceans, these organisms  evolved into land based animals carrying on similar bone structures.  Appendages evolved to adapt the species better to it's environment (Ie. the presense of wings versus arms)+=I determined that squirrels and humas are closely related to one another as they are both land based organisms, that are warm blooded and have arms (versus wings).  I detmerined that butterflies and crocodiles are not closely related as butterflies have an exoskeletal structure while crocodiles have an endoskeletal structure.  Though both evolved from organisms that had no skeletal structure at all, the crocodile and butterfly evolved differently to be more adaptive to their environments. +=+=Section 04+=">

I tried to figure out how I would get to human and decided to infer from what we saw in Lab 1. There is the idea/hypothesis that we share the common limb structure and so I decided to evolve from bugs to birds using the need to fly as a connector. The text boxes made it hard to enter more than 3-4 words at a time and so my thoughts may not appear complete. There was a flying squirrel type animal at HMNH that gave me the idea to go from squirrel to human. Bird progresses into squirrel, squirrel into human as the need to fly no longer exists.+=It seemed like there were a lot of missing links. For example, mammals such as chimps didn't exist as stepping stones to get to humans. This made it difficult to get from bugs and sharks to humans.  Bugs and reptiles don't seem well or closely related to humans, which is why this exercise seemed so difficult. I reasoned that sharks were more like reptiles just from logical reason, and so they should follow down the path from slugs/snails, which were more amphibian/aquatic in likeness compared to other animals. I decided to branch from arachnids/bugs to mammals because there was always an apparent leg structure, whereas I went to reptiles losing their legs as was the case of snails. Eventually they were regained with animals such as the turtle. Much seemed missing.+=+=Section 05+=">

Next, the organisms with internal structures, such as fish and sharks, which are also ancient and largely unchanged. I know that the first land-dwelling creatures evolved from a type of lung fish, and that reptiles followed afterwards, with mammals branching off of that. Bats, birds and whales are good examples of parrallel evolution, as mammals evolved out of the water and birds and bats don't have a common flying ancestor.  I'm not sure how insects are related to one another, only that they're not nearly as intimately related as they seem. +=The pattern of nature is simplicity to complexity. That is, developing or 'fine tuning' natural structures takes more time. A good rule of thumb, then, is to compare relative complexity. A jellyfish is a relatively simple organism, with no skeleletal structure at all. Fish, with internal skeletons, are more complex, but lungs and air-breathing ie even more involved. I also remember that the ability to regrow body parts is an ancient one, and that organisms that are capable of that, such as starfish, lizards and so forth, are older than the newer species in which that ability faded away.  +=+=Section 03+=">

For example, I guess that a centipede is in some way related to a leech. This is due to their similar yet different body types and the fact that they are both parasites. I feel like this would be a logical example of a long term of evolutionary changes resulting in the life of a centipede.+=+=Section 11+=">

An example would be how I put the spider, horseshoe crab, and insects in the anthropod group, because they had segmented bodies, and then i put snails and leeches in a group because they had unsegmented bodies.  They all share a common ancestor though, so both groups were branched off of that same ancestor.+=I decided they were closely related to one another by comparing key characteristics about them.  Some species had segmented bodies, other didn't.  For example, all the vertebrates were related to each other, but also divided into groups that signified who was closely related.  All mammals were put into a group , same with reptiles, etc.  I knew which species were mammals because all mammals breastfeed and I could point out which of the species breastfed.

However, this mostly revolves around the methods that these animals bring forth their offspring. For example, the one thing that birds have in common with creatures such as lizards and crocodiles is that they don't give birth to live young. Instead their offspring is both from eggs that are expelled from the parent's body.  In contrast to this, sharks, humans, rats, bats, and squirrels are mammals whose young develop inside the female's body  and  is born alive after a period of time. As for the insects, I grouped them based on their body structure.+=As mentioned in the previous question, it was initially based on the method that these animals brought forth young. (sharks and humans are related because they bring forth live young while birds and lizards are related because they lay eggs) . However the animals can also be related if their bodies are taken into account. This could be seen in the case of rats, squirrels and bats. Despite the fact that a bat is able to fly like a bird, it  gives birth to live offspring , has claws , teeth, and is covered in fur. This makes it a little closer to the other rodents than birds.+=+=Section 04+=">

Next, I began separating them  into subgroups.  For example, I separated the vertebrates  up into mammals (human,whale, rat,etc...), amphibians (lizard, crocodile, etc...and birds (because I believed that they are in a group of their own).  I separated the invertebrates up  into Fish (shark and fish) and anthropods  (including the insects and crustaceans).  The branches I added coming off of the  jellyfish signifies the land-dwelling and sea-dwelling anthropod creatures.+=Basically, I used common sense in guessing which animals were closely related.  For example, I said that humans are close to rats, because I know that a rat's brain is capable of learning making these animals quite smart.  Another reason I linked these two was because they are both mammals  and give live birth.  I linked the crocodile to the lizard because frankly, lizards look like miniature crocodiles with the same body structure, scales, tail, and four shout legs.  I clumped all the animals with no back bones into the invertebrate section, starting with the jellyfish.  The big difference in the invertebrates are the land dwelling and sea dwelling one.  So, from the jellyfish, I attached all of the land dwelling animals in one section, and the sea dwelling in the other.   +=+=Section 05+=">
