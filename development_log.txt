	finally worked

refactoring to model-view-controller
	model = SurveyData singleton
	

10/3/08
made parameters
	Scoring = true enables scoring mode if Password = SurveyUI.PASSWORD

- permanently enabled for debugging purposes in surveyUI

set up database on www.securebio.umb.edu

dbname = trees
user  = treesurvey
pswd = tr335urvey

logged in as root
mysql -u root -pmy3quel

edited /etc/cron.daily/backup_databases to backup this db
put new version on securebio

put treeDB.pm in /usr/lib/perl5/5.8.5
chmod +x

trying to use javascript to talk to applet
does not work in safari!
does in firefox.

10/16/08
tried in safari using a safari bookmark that lets you run arbitrary javascript code
tried to look at document.TreeApplet and got this
Error: java.security.PrivilegedActionException: sun.plugin.liveconnect.OriginNotAllowedException: 
      JavaScript is not from the same origin as the Java code, 
      caller=https://www.securebio.umb.edu/cgi-bin/TreeSurvey.pl, 
      callee=http://www.securebio.umb.edu/phylogenySurvey.jar

note that the caller is in https and the callee is http
therefore, move phylogenySurvey.jar to /var/www/sslhtdocs
and change reference in TreeSurvey.pl

now works!!

10/21/08
trouble debugging applet
it would not be updated in browser
therefore (on server only) change name to phylogenySurvey.1.jar etc

still NG
the applet keeps the links & puts all organisms back to start
the link persists even if logged in to another user!
- the browser must be caching something!

10/22/08
tried using start() in JApplet
still NG

10/31/08
finally added stop() method to applet 
also SurveyData.reset() that resets the database
now there is no carryover
BUT state not restored - looking at html, the tree description is incomplete
- url encoding is messing it up
- need another way to deal with "poison" characters - so it's not read as XML 
- it was not being restored because I was resetting the SurveyData at the wrong time!

now AOK - need to connect to db

almost working -
	1) date saves 00 00 00 etc.
	2) on first entry, any moved organisms are duplicated (?)

11/04/08
probably some singleton issues with the SurveyData
maybe zapping different versions?
try making it a regular object

lots of refactoring too
 - need to move drawingpanel from the non-gui methods
 	do the add to drawing panel outside of SurveyData

still getting duplications but better design..

try having it only load the default critters if the set state string is blank

now OK
but
- split fails

fixed it

still need to 
1) get DATE working
2) get pre-post working

got date working
 -only pre post left

1/14/09
working..
- fixed shark pic (added fins..)
- punt pre-post for now
- fix db
	nuke prepost: ALTER TABLE student_data DROP prepost;
	nuke Q3: ALTER TABLE student_data DROP Q3;
		delete from perl script
	add field for 13 questions: ALTER TABLE student_data ADD Q3 varchar(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0';
		one big field - comma-separated integers
    got it working!
    
    set up admin passwd - lab09acce55 - that allows login for scoring
    
2/8/09
starting to use it with students
strange bug - sometimes all the organisms are missing
- sometimes the xml is blank & re-loading it fixes the problem
- sometimes, the xml has no organisms
-> fix the SurveyApplet to check for "OrganismLabel" in the submitted xml- if not present, load all orgs

2/9/09
added to perl script that it shows if the survey has been entered next to the person's name 
  in the login page
